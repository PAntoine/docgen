Document Generator
==================

Why?
----

I need a tool to be able to write documentation that stays in step
with the code. But, I want to documentation to have the format of
a document and not be decided by the code. Also I want to be able
to generate diagrams (state machines and sequence diagrams) from
within the code.

Also, I want the documentation to be decided by the build system
so that it can be reshaped to match the delivery.

What?
-----

This document generation system is built in the style that the code
is built. That is a compiler and a linker. This means that the documentation
can be generated by rules in the makefile in the same way that the
code is.

The final documentation will be built using a real document that will
reference the generated docs when will then be inserted. This also 
means that the same data can be placed within the document as many
times as required.

The input format of the docs will be based on MarkDown. This is a because
MarkDown is simple to use and they are many tools that can convert this
into any document style.

Implementation
--------------

It has been implemented as mentioned above as a pair of commands, the compiler (*psdc*)
and the linker (*psdl*). 

The current compiler generates an output file that is passed into the linker. As this
models the intermediate files from compilation this should speed up the generation of
the documentation as this will only get re-generated when the source files change.

Currently, the compiler does not include a pre-processor or depend on the C/C++ one.
If required it can always be called and have the result passed into the compiler.

The current specification is where to look for the state of play 
[Spec](https://github.com/PAntoine/doc_gen/blob/master/docs/specification.txt) and
to see how to use it, it will be worth looking at the test suite that will be build
on the back of a gmake make systems.

For how to use the functions look in the tests as this is a make system that will 
build the files in the source directory.

What's left to do?
------------------

It currently only produces simple state diagrams from the source and links them but
only generates the state diagrams in dot (graphViz) format, just so I can see the
functions working.

The current plan is to finish the diagram linking and internal diagrams. The create
a final object format for the documents and then produce a tool for converting this
to a document.

The current formats that are planned to be supported are MarkDown, TeX and HTML. Thought
the last one can be generated from TeX.

Also, need to extend it for different languages, especially looking at VHDL as the 
auto generation of state machines would be of really great use.

Anyway
------

Enjoy, the stupidity of the above.
