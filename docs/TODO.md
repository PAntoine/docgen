1. Memory Leaks

There are definitely memory leaks in the handling of the triggers in the linker.
The arrays that are added to the node are not cleared down.

Valgrind the f**k out of this code as it is really poor in places.

2. Name allocation

Will have to replace what I have with a lookup table and proper allocation. Too much memory is being used and the names are having to be copied.
Also must use hashes to make the searches quicker. As part of this need to change the file format, seems mad to unpack and re-pack it in the
linker. The format that the compiler generates in the format that will be linked in the linker. All that is needed is the objects to reference
themselves.

3. Functions/Activations

This is wrong. What I have currently called a function is actually an activation.

It needs to change so when the C based stuff is include within the build then it can use the function name.

I might be worth adding a "procedure" name into the system to allow for RPC to be done. But is that any different to a @send???

Also, need to add code to allow for the order of the items to be changed. This will be a configuration option.

4. Efficiency

Some of the atoms lists are being searched to add to the end. What is required is an end of list pointer to handle this without searching.

5. Duplication

The message now has a redundant field (timeline) as sender has that information (probably a lot of these).

6. De-HACKify

This code is the epitome, the shining star, the touch stone, the ultimate example of hacky code.
This desperately needs turning into grown-up code.

Some of this code makes bunny's eyes bleed. :)

6.1 replace the parser.
	Rolling my own (non-generic) parser is just so f**king stupid. Rip this out and replace with a yacc
	based version. Make the node handing code be a set of functions that can be called from yacc. Also
	change the input to plugins like the output and make this all loverly.

6.2 strings
    Need to implement a proper string table and hash lookup. This will save time copying strings and
	effort during searching. Also, this string table could be exported in the file and the linker and
	processor use the same string table and lookups.

6.3 lists
    The linked lists I use are stupid. They should be based on the same code, handle end addition better
	and use the hashes that will be generated by the string table. Also, be a little smarter in there
	coding. In-fact there should be code to handle linked lists in common that is used everywhere.

6.4 file format.
   The file formats (the intermediate) does not have a size at the front. That means it is not properly
   backwards compatible. This should be fixed. It might also make sense to rationalise the record types
   now I know what they all are.

 
7. Constants/Constant

This is wrong. The @constants is correct as this will allow for a group of constants to be formed. BUT, there
should also be a @constant that is named. This will allow for properly named constants to be accessed.  Also
they will/can be laid out with descriptions.

Also, add end of line comments for sections of the constants. This should almost come for free with replacing
the parser.

8. Text Format

This has been handled wrong in the draw_state. This should have it's own "format_state" object. It has been
intertwined in the draw_state structure. This needs to be removed and the structure fixed to be properly
generic, use the format_state properly like the other formats.

9. Implement Records/Fields/Streams

This was originally in the idea but has been dropped. I want fields for records. This will allow for a message
to be defined and the fields added. This will also work for data types so that complex code can define data
types properly and add those in. It will also help with some of the other languages that are planned.

10. Document Controls

To be able to control the document. Some formats will have page breaks and headers and footers. Also would be
nice to be able to add an control (i.e. for manpages) that items are produced in a section. The manpage sections
have a standard order and this is not enforced anywhere.

11. Documentation.

Left this at the bottom. Nothing has been documented for this code. This system has not been used on this code. shhh!!!!
