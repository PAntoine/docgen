Description
    Document Source Linker This application will take all the specified input_files that have been generated from the
    document compiler *pdsc* and link them together as a  single object file. This object will have all the components for
    each of the compiled source files, it will link all objects that are either grouped together or reference each other
    (i.e. state_machines or sequence_diagrams). It produces an output file that can be passed to the document processor
    (*pdp*) that can be used as the model to be used to generate final documents.
